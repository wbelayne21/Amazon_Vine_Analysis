# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis 
  The purpose of this analysis is to investigate the success of the Amazon Vine Program where manufacturers pay fees for users to publish a review. We are tasked with parsing reviews for jewleries comparing the responses between vine members and regular users ultimately checking if there is a bias in 5-star ratings.

### Results

   - There were 21 Vine sponsored/paid and 7685 unpaid helpful reviews. 
   - There were 11 5-Star Vine reviews and 4443 non-vine 5-star reviews.
   - percentwise vine and non-vine reviews had 52.4% and 57.8% 5-star ratings respectively
   
#### Summary
  In summary, since the percentage of 5-star vine reviews is less than that of non-vine reviews, we can assume that there is not that much of a positive bias. However to be accurate in our analysis we should compare the parameters against the significance of our data/results using statistics. We could expand this study to include analysis of test statistics such as t-test. We are comparing the percentages of a 21 verus 7500 samples points which wouldn't give us a plausible conclusion.
